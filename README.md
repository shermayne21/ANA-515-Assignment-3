Storm Events 1997 -
The data used can be found in NOAA’s Storm Events Database (https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/).
I've chosen 19997's weather-related storm events as that is my birthyear.

1: Limited the dataframe to 21 variables. 
2: Changed state and county names to title case. 
3: Limited to the events listed by county FIPS and removed the column.
4: United the state and county FIPS with a “0” at the beginning. 
5: Changed all the column names to lower case. 
5: Used data on U.S. states from R, and created a data frame. 
6: Created a dataframe with number of events per state in 1997. 
7: Merged the U.S. state and number of events per state in 1997 dataframes.
8: Removed any states that are not in the state information dataframe. 
9. Created plot
